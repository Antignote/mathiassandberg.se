I'm currently working as a Software Architect at the state-owned company Svenska Spel in Sweden.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        With <strong>{yearDiff(startWorkingDate, now)} years</strong> of working experience in software development I tend to live by the rules of Murphys law &ndash; <em>&quot;anyhing that can go wrong will eventually go wrong&quot;.</em> That means that I leave nothing to chance; defensive application design and architecture is the key features. I put much effort to achieve applications with great performance and that are easily tested with either unit tests or regression tests.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Quality and user experience is for me, one of the most important things to achieve. Engaging users with the product via making them fast, easy and fun to use.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        One of my best assets is that I'm always reading up on and learning the latest technology, or programming paradigms. I'm effective and can lead a group or be a follower when needed.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I always care to help my colleagues &ndash; <em>sharing is caring.</em> There is always something new to learn and I believe that discussing possible solutions and exchanging experience is a exceptional way to both build a better application and to grow as a developer.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        My passion for programming started at a young age where I tend to debug, inspect and improve existing web applications. My newly gained interest evolved to into taking a couple of programming courses in high school, which eventually lead me through a technical gymnasial program, followed by a couple of years with studies at university within a program with a very wide spectrum within software development. After the university it took me to where I'm today; loving the development process from an idea to a high qualitative application or evolving existing applications.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3><Heart /> Love</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Performant web applications</li>\n        <li>Great architecture &amp; testable code</li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h3>💩 Dislikes</h3>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Laggy animations</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>💻 Work life experience</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Svenska Spel, Software Architect dec 2020</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Leading frontend development and responsible for its life cycle managment for Svenska Spels pool games like; Stryktipset, Europatipset, Challenge etc.</li>\n            <li>Evaluating, identifying, designing and developing software solutions</li>\n            <li>Functional and technical documentation</li>\n            <li>Work close to product owners (PO)</li>\n            <li>Mentoring and introducing new developers to the tech stack</li>\n            <li><em>...Same chores as a frontend developer according to below</em></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n\n        <li><strong>Svenska Spel, Frontend developer aug 2016 - dec 2020</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>React ecosystem (Redux, RTK, React Router, RTL etc.)</li>\n            <li>Nodejs</li>\n            <li>Express.js</li>\n            <li>SEO, Google core Web Vitals</li>\n            <li>REST</li>\n            <li>Docker</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n\n        <li><strong>Skatteverket, developer dec 2012 - jun 2016</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Java EE</li>\n            <li>Servlets, JSF, Apache Strust</li>\n            <li>JavaScript</li>\n            <li>File streams</li>\n            <li>XML Parsing</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>🎓 Education</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Bachelor's Programme in Programming</strong>, Linköping Technical University (LiTH) 2009 - 2012\n          <ul>\n            <li>Enterprise development</li>\n            <li>Game design &amp; development</li>\n            <li>Web development &ndash; client &amp; server</li>\n            <li>Computer Networks &amp; Distributed Systems</li>\n            <li>Datastructures &amp; algorithms</li>\n            <li>Construction of a programming language - <em>final state machines, abstract syntax tree, shunting yard algorithm,  etc.</em></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Technical program</strong>, Christopher Polhemgymnasiet 2006 - 2008\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"names":["hearts","startWorkingDate","Date","now","title","startDate","diffYear","getTime","Math","abs","round"],"sourceRoot":""}
