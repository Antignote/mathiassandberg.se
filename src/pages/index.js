      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Mathias Sandberg</strong>. I'm currently work as a Software Architect at the state-owned company Svenska Spel in Sweden.
      </p>

      <p>
        With <strong>{yearDiff(startWorkingDate, now)} years</strong> of working experience in software development I tend to live by the rules of Murphys law &ndash; <em>&quot;anyhing that can go wrong will eventually go wrong&quot;.</em> That means that I leave nothing to chance; defensive architectual application design. I put mutch effort to achive applications with great performance and that are easily tested with either unit tests or regression tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quality and user experience is for me, one of the most important things to achieve. Engaging users with the product via making them fast, easy and fun to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my best assets is that I'm always reading up on and learning the latest technology, or programming paradigms. I'm effective and can lead a group or be a follower when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        I always care to help my colleagues &ndash; <em>sharing is caring.</em> There is always something new to learn and I believe that discussing possible solutions and exchanging experience is a exceptional way to both build a better application and to grow as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My passion for programming started at a young age where I tend to debug, inspect and improve existing web applications. My newly gained interest evolved to into taking a couple of programming courses in high school, which eventually lead me through a technical gymnasial program, followed by a couple of years with studies at university within a program with a very wide spectrum within software development. After the university it took me to where I'm today; loving the development process from an idea to a high qualitative application or evolving existing applications.
