      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Mathias Sandberg</strong>. I'm currently work as a Software Architect at the state-owned company Svenska Spel in Sweden.
      </p>

      <p>
        With <strong>{yearDiff(startWorkingDate, now)} years</strong> of experience in software development and I tend to live by the rules of Murphys law &ndash; <em>&quot;anyhing that can go wrong will eventually go wrong&quot;.</em> That means that I leave nothing to chance; defensive architectual application design. I put much effort to achive applications with great performance that are easily tested with either unit tests or regression tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        I always care to help my colleagues &ndash; <em>sharing is caring.</em> There is always something new to learn and I beleive that discussing possible solutions and excanging experience is a exceptional way to both build a better application and to grow as a developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        My passion for web development started at a young age where I tend to debug, inspect and improove existing web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        On my spare time I like to stay up to date and read up on new technology, or programming paradigms - because one thing that's important to me is great architectual code that is also testable with unittests
